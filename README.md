# Seek

##### A geo location based voluntary teacher and student pairing service.

Seek helps students find the voluntary teachers nearby to learn anything they wish.
Mentors are paired according to your preferences (like speed of talking), location and the subject they are knowledgeable in.
This is specially useful to university students.
Say that you want to learn some part of Machine Learning in more details because your lecture content doesnâ€™t cover enough content.
But where will you find a suitable person to teach you machine learning? This is where seek comes in.
It searches for nearby volunteers who are good at machine learning. And the both parties can arrange a time for the mentor session through the same app.
Seek also promotes the social aspects of students, allowing them to meet more people in the subject areas that they are interested in.
